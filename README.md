# Car Genius
Car Genius is a used-car price predictor developed for my thesis in the Data Science Master from KSchool. The name is the result of combining the words Car and Genius , the last one as a synonym of Guru related to the aim of this project which is to build a machine learning  algorithm able to predict the price of any used car in Spain based on the current used cars market and applying the knowledge acquired during this master.

The project will cover all phases related to a Data Science project, involving the data acquisition and transformation, analysis, including the evaluation of the different machine learning models and will end with a frontend or visualization tool that will allow users to interact with the algorithm.
